# Why I built the project this way

My goal was to build an Admin Dashboard that could be developed to use a database in the future.

- I used the official [Tremor documentation](https://www.tremor.so/) and components.

- For this project, I opted to use Tremor a React Libary. This allowed me to build Dashboards very quickly. However, the components do not have a lot of customization and limited styling. With this also being a library that is often updated, it causes bugs and issues during development if you want to use the current version.
- For this project, I opted to use react-router as it allowed me to have multiple pages. I found it to be a very user-friendly and efficient library that helped me create fast, seamless pages for my project.
- For this project, I did not use a state manager for this project. However, the Context API would be a great options to handle theme switching.
- TypeScript in my opinion is a must-have in all projects in 2023. It helps keep your code cleaner, bug-free and has better writing practices.
- SCSS/CSS Modules is an awesome library for styling. However, a styling Library for this project would of increased production speed.

# If I had more time I would change this

- Use Context API for theme switching
- Hook up a database for all the chart data.
- Create better styles or use a styling library for consistency and production speed.
- Use a testing library to set up, create, and execute tests
